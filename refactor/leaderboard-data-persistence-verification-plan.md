# Leaderboard Data Persistence Verification Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to verify and fix the Astro Breaker leaderboard data persistence functionality. The leaderboard contains three main sections:

1. **All-Time Highscores**: Shows rank, player, score, and date.
2. **Best Round Scores**: Shows rank, player, round, score, and date.
3. **Personal Best**: Shows highest score, best round score, highest combo, games played, total wins, and last updated.

The plan will address issues with data accuracy, display formatting, and the incorrectly included "Show Leaderboard During Game" option.

## Phase 1: Data Structure and Code Fixes

### 1.1 Fix LeaderboardManager Implementation Issues

- Implement proper qualification checks before adding scores
- Add game mode indicator to leaderboard entries
- Ensure personal best dates are updated correctly for each record
- Fix potential double-counting of games played
- Implement data validation for incoming values
- Fix inconsistent score normalization

### 1.2 Fix Round Highscores Implementation

- Add filtering by round number for better organization
- Implement proper qualification checks for round scores
- Limit entries per player to prevent single-player domination
- Add game mode indicators to round score entries
- Fix player name display in round highscores

### 1.3 Fix Personal Best Implementation

- Update date timestamps independently for each personal best category
- Store the date for individual records (when each best was achieved)
- Fix the updatePlayerBest method to include all stats
- Add proper data validation

### 1.4 Remove "Show Leaderboard During Game" Option

- Remove the showLeaderboard property from the PlayerPersistentData interface
- Remove related UI toggle element
- Remove the setLeaderboardVisibility method
- Update any code that depends on this setting

## Phase 2: UI/UX Improvements

### 2.1 Leaderboard Display Enhancements

- Improve formatting of dates (human-readable format)
- Add rank changes to all sections (up/down/new indicators)
- Highlight the current player's entries
- Add section headers for better organization
- Color-code entries based on game mode

### 2.2 UI Consistency

- Ensure all leaderboard panels use the same styling
- Move leaderboard styles to dedicated CSS files
- Implement responsive design for better visibility on different devices
- Add loading states for when data is being fetched

### 2.3 Navigation Improvements

- Add tabs for switching between leaderboard sections
- Implement sorting options for each column
- Add filtering options (e.g., by time period, by game mode)

## Phase 3: Testing and Verification

### 3.1 Update Test Suite

- Add tests for qualification checks
- Add tests for data validation
- Add tests for proper date updating
- Add tests for game mode differentiation
- Add tests for UI rendering

### 3.2 Manual Testing Protocol

Create a comprehensive testing protocol covering:

- Data persistence across sessions
- Score recording in different game modes
- UI display correctness for all sections
- Date formatting and updating
- Performance with large datasets
- Error handling and recovery

### 3.3 Verification Checklist

Develop a verification checklist to ensure all requirements are met:

- All-Time Highscores display correct rank, player, score, date
- Best Round Scores display correct rank, player, round, score, date
- Personal Best shows accurate highest score, best round score, highest combo, games played, total wins, last updated
- "Show Leaderboard During Game" option has been removed
- All data is correctly persisted between sessions
- UI is consistent and properly formatted

## Phase 4: Integration and Deployment

### 4.1 Code Integration

- Integrate fixes into the main codebase
- Resolve any conflicts with recent changes
- Update documentation to reflect changes

### 4.2 Leaderboard Data Migration

- Create migration script for existing leaderboard data (if needed)
- Backup current data before applying changes
- Implement versioning for leaderboard data structure

### 4.3 Deployment Validation

- Deploy changes to a test environment
- Verify functionality in the test environment
- Create rollback plan in case of issues

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes and Components

1. **LeaderboardManager** (src/managers/leaderboard-manager.ts)
   - Central component for data persistence
   - Needs fixes for player names, qualification checks, and date handling

2. **ScoreManager** (src/managers/score-manager.ts)
   - Tracks scores during gameplay
   - Integrates with LeaderboardManager

3. **RoundUI** (src/managers/round/components/round-ui.ts)
   - Handles display of game state and scores
   - Updates leaderboard display

4. **UI HTML** (assets/ui/index.html)
   - Contains leaderboard display elements
   - Contains "Show Leaderboard During Game" toggle that needs removal

### Hytopia SDK Integration Points

- Uses `PersistenceManager.instance.getGlobalData/setGlobalData` for global leaderboard
- Uses `PersistenceManager.instance.getPlayerData/setPlayerData` for player-specific data
- Score normalization for different game modes (solo vs multiplayer)


### Success Criteria

1. All leaderboard sections display the correct data in the proper format
2. All data persists correctly between game sessions
3. No unexpected behavior or errors during gameplay
4. "Show Leaderboard During Game" option has been removed
5. All tests pass with 100% success rate
6. Performance is acceptable with large datasets
7. Code is clean, well-documented, and follows project conventions
